This is my gnome terminal setup :)

## Setup
This config file is strictly for unix environments. Color theme can only be used for gnome-terminal and its variations.

+ First, install zsh. `sudo apt-get install zsh`
+ Then, copy .zshrc and .p10k.zsh files to `~`
+ Then, run zsh to initialize the initial setup.
+ (Optional) Add gnome-terminal profile by following the instructions here https://gist.github.com/ozanuslan/d625aa7f983d22e1e7bc304e4b3fa2ee
+ Done!
